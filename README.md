# VirusAndVaccines
Android application for SpaceApps 2021 Hackathon developed by Latitude team!   
This application is born to unify gamification with a theme so delicate as the Covid-19. Virus & Vaccines shows at the same time two faces of the same medal: what the Covid is doing right now with a series of datas taken from [rapidapi.com]("https://rapidapi.com/vaccovidlive-vaccovidlive-default/api/vaccovid-coronavirus-vaccine-and-treatment-tracker/") and what we can do to live our lifes alongside the pandemic. 
With V&V, you can build your character simply adding to it what you are taking with you to fight Covid-19: masks, sanitizer, vaccine. When you put on a mask, annotate it in V&V, the app will track the period of validity of it. 
When you put on the equipment, your player will gain boosts in his statistics, use them to bring your country on the top of the world!
