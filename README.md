# VirusAndVaccines
Android application for [SpaceApps 2021 Hackathon]("https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org") developed by [Latitude team]("https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/covid-19-calculate-the-risk/teams/latitude/members")!

## The challenge
[**COVID-19: Calculate the Risk**]("https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/covid-19-calculate-the-risk"): COVID-19 continues to be a global problem even though vaccination efforts are underway to control its propagation. Your challenge is to use environmental data and other information (such as epidemiological, social, policy, and economic data) to build a smartphone application that provides individualized, geolocated, COVID-19 risk warnings to guide social awareness, response, and health security.

## What Virus & Vaccines does
This application is born to unify gamification with a theme so delicate as the Covid-19. Virus & Vaccines shows at the same time two faces of the same medal: what the Covid is doing right now with a series of datas taken from [rapidapi.com]("https://rapidapi.com/vaccovidlive-vaccovidlive-default/api/vaccovid-coronavirus-vaccine-and-treatment-tracker/") and what we can do to live our lifes alongside the pandemic.    

With V&V, you can build your character simply adding to it what you are taking with you to fight Covid-19: masks, sanitizer, vaccine. When you put on a mask, annotate it in V&V, the app will track the period of validity of it. 
When you put on the equipment, your player will gain boosts in his statistics, use them to bring your country on the top of the world!

In addition, the application offers a section that shows to the users a list of _Covid free_ activities that she/he can do. The idea was born thinking about milions of people that, during the hardest period of pandemic, remained isolated at home not knowing what to do because of the fear for Covid-19.
